### Full Stack Weather Application

This project is a full-stack weather application that demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs to fetch weather data for a specified city. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and it utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information.

#### Front End
The front end of the application consists of a simple user interface where users can enter the name of a city and click a button to fetch the weather information. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with input validation to handle errors.

#### Back End
The back end of the application is handled by the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides the weather data for the specified city. The API request is made using JavaScript's `fetch` method, and the response is processed to display the weather information on the front end.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how RESTful APIs work and how they can be integrated into a full-stack application. By building this application, the developer gains practical experience in working with APIs, handling API requests and responses, and displaying data dynamically on a web page.

#### Future Improvements
- Implementing more features, such as forecasting and location suggestions.
- Enhancing the user interface with more interactive elements and animations.
- Adding error handling for cases where the API request fails or the city is not found.

Overall, this project serves as a valuable learning experience for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of full-stack development and API integration.
